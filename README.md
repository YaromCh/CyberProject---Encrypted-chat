Encrypting and decrypting messages using cryptographic tools

Encrypting and decrypting messages using cryptographic tools:
Transferring temporary keys by scanning QR code,
creating a new symmetric encryption key using XOR,
at the beginning of each message performing another XOR with random characters to create a new sequence,
padding the message with random characters and adding a success / authentication label,
execution XOR in 8-character sequences for information encryption.

Option to send unencrypted messages (user selected).

Work environment: Android Studio
Programming language: JAVA
DB connection: Firebase
